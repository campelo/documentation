If you're looking for duplicated values in a excel sheet, you can find them easily.

## Identifying duplicate values

We need to select the columns or cells that have duplicate values and select Home > Conditional Formatting > Highlight Cells Rules > Duplicate Values

After that we could right-click on one of the duplicate cells and choose Filter > Filter by Selected Cell's Color

All duplicated cells will be filtered

To clear conditional filter, choose Conditional Formatting > Clear Rules > Clear Rules from Entire Sheet
