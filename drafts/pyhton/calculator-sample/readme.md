## Calculator sample

Create a new file called Calculator.py and add this code

```python
firstNumber = input("Enter the first number: ") # it will wait user input for the first number
secondNumber = input("Enter the second number: ")  # it will wait user input for the second number
total = firstNumber + secondNumber # it will keep the result in a variable called total
print(total)  # it will show the result
```

To execute this python program you can execute it with the command

```bash
python3 calculator.py
```
