## Variables

**Python infers types of variables**. This means that you don't need to write string, boolean, int or others to explicit declarations to work with variables. 

Create a new file called Calculator.py and add this code

```
firstNumber = 2
secondNumber = 5.3
total = firstNumber + secondNumber
print(total)
```

You can access this code on [github](https://github.com/campelo/Python-First-steps).
**py** extension is either called a python program or python script.
