## Variables


### Calculator sample

Create a new file called Calculator.py and add this code

```
firstNumber = 2 // integer number
secondNumber = 5.3  // float number
total = firstNumber + secondNumber // float will be used
result = "The total is " + total // it'wll concatenate a string with the total float result
print(result)  // it will print the result
```
